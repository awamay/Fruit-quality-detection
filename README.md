# Fruit-quality-detection
A web-interface made with Django to predict quality of fruits.
The machine learning model is trained on a fruits dataset taken from kaggle.
Link to dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification

The models is a binary classifier that classifies fruits as Fresh / Rotten.


Modification:
As a next step, the focus is on disease classification fo fruits.
The model was trained on apple fruit leaves with four main diseases and the dataset was taken from Kaggle.

There are various limitations to the current scope of the model in terms of the dataset itself, due to inadeqaute availibility of a fruits disease dataset.
